      "Context: There was a lot of optimism for the Patriots this season. They started their first game by winning against the Saints, 57-40. They would continue their success against the Rams (21-9) before losing to the Jaguars as their quarterback was injured and they only scored 20 points. Edging out a difficult victory, the Patriots were able to beat the Raiders 57 to 9, but lost to the Falcons 16 to 10, and their low point in the season seemd to come from a particularly tough loss to 49ers (25-11). A tough win against the Steelers, where they scored 54 to their opponents 0 points, was compounded by another win against the Lions, 56 to 26. They would rally to win the final two games, 30 to 7 and 48 to 33.\n",
